# work-day-scheduler

## Overview 
A simple scheduling application built to maintain an 8hr work day (9am - 5pm) by allowing the user to input tasks into hourly time-blocks and allowing the user to save those tasks on the time-blocks to persist when ever they wish to re open the Work Day Scheduler.

## Functionality 
Upon loading the page the user is able to see the current date and time displayed at the top of the page below the title. Below the displayed time are 9 time-blocks with which the hour is represented to the left of the time-block, an input area for the user to input tasks in the center and a save button on the right to save the tasks to the page. The time-blocks are color coded as well in tandem with the time of the day so that tasks that are in the past are highlighted in grey, tasks that are in the present are highlighted in red, and tasks in the fututre are highlighted in green. The user can simpy click on the input field to fill in the tasks they wish to add to the tinme-block and once those items are saved by clicking the save button, the input tasks will persist even after the page has been closed and reloaded.

## Code
The majority of the page's functionality was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Jquery. Most functions for adding style to time-blocks and saving and loading the user input was built using Jquery or vanilla JavaScript.
